Task:
The final grades for a Physics exam taken by a large group of students
have a mean of Î¼ = 70 and a standard deviation of Ïƒ = 10.
If we can approximate the distribution of these grades by a normal distribution,
what percentage of the students:
    - Scored higher than 80 (i.e., have a grade > 80)?
    - Passed the test (i.e., have a grade >= 60)?
    - Failed the test (i.e., have a grade < 60)?
Find and print the answer to each question on a new line, rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.
